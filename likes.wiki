_HIL_
*things to talk about*:
	* How must HILs be '_conversationally useful_'?
		- How should we expect _dislikes_ to be 'conversationally useful'?
			* 'That's the idiocy they use to run this place.'
			* difference between '*bad management*' and '*bad living situation*'? Is one more conversationally useful than the other?
